b. How will it be able to solve the problem?
Seismic detection across the solar system can address several scientific questions and challenges by:
1. Understanding Planetary Interiors:
Differentiation
Tectonic Activity
Core Dynamics
2. Detecting Impact Events:
Asteroid and Comet Impacts
3. Exploring Potential Habitability:
Internal Heat
Water Presence
4. Resource Exploration:
Mineral and Energy Resources
