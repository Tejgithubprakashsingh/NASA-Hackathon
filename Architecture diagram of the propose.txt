Architecture diagram of the proposed solution
Here is the architecture diagram for the Seismic Detection Across the Solar System solution. It illustrates the deployment of seismometers across various celestial bodies, communication satellites for data transmission, a central Earth-based control center, and systems for data analysis and visualization.
