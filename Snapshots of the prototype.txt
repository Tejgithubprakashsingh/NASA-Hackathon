Snapshots of the prototype
These are hypothetical images based on common design elements for space-based instruments. Actual prototypes may vary in appearance and specific features.
Description: A seismometer mounted on a spacecraft, ready for deployment on a celestial body.

Description: A close-up view of the internal components of a seismometer, including sensors, electronics, and data storage.
Description: A spacecraft landing on a planet, deploying a seismometer on the surface.

Description: A visualization of seismic data collected by the prototype, showing the amplitude and frequency of seismic waves.
Additional Considerations:
Size and Weight: The prototype must be designed to be compact and lightweight for efficient transportation and deployment.
Durability: The instruments must be able to withstand the harsh conditions of space, including extreme temperatures, radiation, and microgravity.
