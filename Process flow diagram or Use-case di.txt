Process flow diagram or Use-case diagram
This diagram provides a simplified overview of the process. Actual implementation may involve additional steps and complexities
Mission Planning:

Identify target celestial bodies (e.g., Moon, Mars, Venus, Io).
Design and develop seismometers suitable for the target environments.
Plan launch and deployment strategies.
Launch and Deployment:

Launch spacecraft carrying seismometers to the target celestial bodies.
Deploy seismometers on the surface or subsurface of the target.
Data Collection:

Seismometers continuously monitor seismic activity and record data.
Data is stored locally on the spacecraft or transmitted back to Earth.
Data Transmission:

Seismic data is transmitted back to Earth via communication channels (e.g., radio waves).
Data may be compressed or encoded for efficient transmission.
Data Processing and Analysis:

Data is received and processed on Earth.
Algorithms are used to identify and analyze seismic events.
Data is compared with models of planetary interiors and tectonic processes.
Scientific Interpretation:

Scientists interpret the seismic data to gain insights into planetary structure, dynamics, and evolution.
Discoveries and findings are published and shared with the scientific community.
